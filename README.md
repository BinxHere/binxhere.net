# binxhere.net

uhhhh something something source code something something its all just html and css its can literally be ran on netscape navigator 1.0

site is hosted on github pages hopefully with both ipv4 and ipv6 support, for maxmium performance of loading these 50kb of html 


this site works with any browser that supports SSL 1.2 over the internet (sorry my netscape navigators), the HTML+CSS will load on pretty much anything that can load html.
![works on latest IE with windows 10, or any browser with SSL 1.2 (sorry netscape navigators :/)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BinxHere/binxhere.net/refs/heads/main/assets/IEbh.net.png)
